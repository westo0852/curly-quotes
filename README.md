# Curly quotes

A program that converts straight quotes to curly quotes. I use this to convert quick notes taken on my phone to more professional-looking, typographically correct text for documents or emails.

Usage:
1. Navigate to the directory from command line: `cd .../curly-quotes`
2. Save a text file in the `curly-quotes` directory to give as input to the program
2. Run the program:
    1. `python make_curly.py input.txt` reads the specified text file and writes a file called “output.txt” in the same directory as the program
    2. `python make_curly.py input.txt output.txt` instead writes a file with the name given as the final argument
